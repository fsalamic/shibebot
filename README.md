# How to use this Bot
First things first you will need to install the required dependencies by doing the command bellow (make sure that you have pip installed) :

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have pip installed , do the following commands (if you are using ubuntu) :
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
After installing the needed dependencies , do the following commands :
```
git clone https://github.com/fsalamic/shibebot.git
cd shibebot
```
Once you do these commands, edit the API_TOKEN variable in the python script with your own bots api key, given to you by the https://t.me/BotFather.

As well as add the API key from TheDogAPI and TheCatAPI websites into the command url's.

After doing so, you can run the bot by doing:
```
python3 shibebot.py
```
